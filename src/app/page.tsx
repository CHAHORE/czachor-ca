        My focus? Web dev. I am fascinated by the vast possibilities the web
        offers. From typography and motion design to copywriting and optimizing
        performance, every project is a new adventure. The web is a canvas of
        endless potential, and I am just beginning to uncover its myriad
        possibilities.

        remains the same: to build exceptional websites that blend functionality
        with creativity.
